# CNN_Keras
CNN model implemented with Keras module on MNIST dataset
This is a Convolutional Neural Network model consisting of two layers of Relu activation function for convolution layers and a Softmax layer as activation function for the flattening layer.
The Neural Network uses Categorical Crossentropy as loss function and SGD(Stochastic Gradient Descent) as optimizer.
The model gives an accuracy of 97.11% for the test data.
